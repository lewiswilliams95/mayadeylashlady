### Design
#### Colour Scheme
 The Main Colour's used on the website are; White background, black for text and the contrasting colour of cool blue for the main content. The and nav tiles will change from cool blue to a contrast colour of orange when hovering.
#### Typography
 The Main font used on my whole website is the Lato font, with the backup font being Sans-Serif and Serif. For the title I used Zen Tokyo Zoo in place of a actual graphically designed title. These backup fonts are used if the browser is having trouble importing from google fonts. I have used lato as it is a fresh font that preveys the business a fresh and innovative business.
